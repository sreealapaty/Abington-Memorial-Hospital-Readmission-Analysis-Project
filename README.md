### Analysis of Abington Memorial Hospital's Readmission Rates

This project presents an in-depth analysis of readmission patterns at Abington Memorial Hospital as part of the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP). Focusing on conditions such as heart failure, pneumonia, COPD, and elective hip/knee replacements, I analyzed the Excess Readmission Ratios (ERR) at national, state, and hospital levels to identify areas where readmissions exceeded expectations. 

The findings underscore the importance of optimizing care transitions, strengthening medication management, and enhancing patient education to effectively reduce readmissions. This analysis provides targeted recommendations aimed at lowering readmission rates, reducing healthcare costs, and elevating the quality of patient care.
